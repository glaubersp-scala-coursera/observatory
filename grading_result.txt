Your overall score for this assignment is 0.99 out of 10.00


The code you submitted did not pass all of our tests: your submission achieved a score of
0.00 out of 9.00 in our tests.

In order to find bugs in your code, we advise to perform the following steps:
 - Take a close look at the test output that you can find below: it should point you to
   the part of your code that has bugs.
 - Run the tests that we provide with the handout on your code.
 - The tests we provide do not test your code in depth: they are very incomplete. In order
   to test more aspects of your code, write your own unit tests.
 - Take another very careful look at the assignment description. Try to find out if you
   misunderstood parts of it. While reading through the assignment, write more tests.

Below you can find a short feedback for every individual test that failed.

Our automated style checker tool found issues in your code with respect to coding style: it
computed a style score of 0.99 out of 1.00 for your submission. See below for detailed feedback.

======== LOG OF FAILED TESTS ========
Your solution achieved a testing score of 0 out of 90.

Below you can see a short feedback for every test that failed,
indicating the reason for the test failure and how many points
you lost for each individual test.

Tests that were aborted took too long too complete or crashed the
JVM. Such crashes can arise due to infinite non-terminating
loops or recursion (StackOverflowException) or excessive memory
consumption (OutOfMemoryException).
